<img src="Develop/assets/images/Horiseon%20Webpage.png">

This project (https://jchane00.github.io/Horiseon_Refactor/) provides increased website accessibility for the clients of Horiseon Marketing Agency.

I refactored Horiseon's existing code to include semantic elements, attributes, etc., in order to increase the accessibility of the site.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
